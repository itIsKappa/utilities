* `eudo`\
  Hassle-free command forwarding shell script for `su`.
* `frmtrnm`\
  A python program for formatting and renaming filenames that contain special characters.
  It is especially useful for avoiding quotes and backslashes on every interaction with files. It
  has some power over how the files will be formatted: the set of characters that will be
  replaced (called *bad characters*); the character that will replace the bad characters
  (called *delimeter*); the formatting of file extensions.
